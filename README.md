Texturer
========
Texture Map Generator in JavaScript (node.js, multithreading) is image processing tool that generates texture maps for image sets. It also generates javascript texture maps description file and is able to copy whole directory without processing, but fills texture map description file with image parameters.

How To Install from GitHub
==========================
1) click `Download ZIP`, download and unpack zip archive with Texturer

2) run `npm install` in root folder of texturer (where package.json is located)

How To Install from npm
=======================
run `npm install -g texturer` from command-line

Usage
=====
run `texturer` in folder with config.json (see `example` folder)

Usage from Code
===============
```js
var fs         = require("fs"),
	Texturer   = require("<path to texturer src/index.js>"),
	configFile = "./config.json",
	texturer   = new Texturer(),
	configJSONString;

try {
	configJSONString = fs.readFileSync(configFile, "utf8");
} catch (e) {
	throw new Error("CFG: Can't read config file \"" + configFile + "\n");
}

texturer.generate(configJSONString, function (error) {
	if (error) {
		console.trace("\x1B[91m" + error + "\x1B[39m");
		process.exit(42);
	} else {
		process.exit(0);
	}
}, null);
```

Node-Webkit and Cluster Module
==============================
Due to issues in node-webkit you will need to do some [additional steps](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/node-webkit/OEZxArpmLNo):
* in some node file (which is required from web javascript file) you should set execPath to node.exe instead of nw.exe
```js
var path = require("path");
process.execPath = path.join(path.dirname(process.execPath), '..', 'folder_with_node_exe', 'node.exe');
```
* on cluster initialization you will need to set `silent` attribute to `true`
```js
cluster.setupMaster({
    'exec': __dirname + '/worker.js',
    'silent': true
});
```

Supported file formats
======================
**input:** png, jpeg (.jpeg, .jpg), bmp

**output:** png (or original image file if `copy` task parameter is set to `true`)

TinyPNG.com Service
===================
[tinypng.com service](http://tinypng.com) does advanced lossy compression for PNG images that preserves full alpha transparency.

To use it you will need to receive [API key](https://tinypng.com/developers).
It is free of charge for convert up to 500 images per month. So, up to 500 texture maps, which is more than enough.

####License
create (or edit) next section in `config.json`:
```json
"tinypng-api-keys": [
	{
		"used": 0,
		"month": 0,
		"year": 0,
		"key": "fhdskaj89fdsfds8a7f89dsa78df7as-"
	}
]
```
> After first use of tinypng.com service this information will be updated with correct month/year/used values.

####Usage
To enable tinypng conversion you need to set `tinypng : true` in task for texture map generation

config.json format
==================
> _note: all folders described below are **relative to current working directory**_

property                    | value
--------------------------- | -----------
nameSpace                   | is just a javascript namespace to which array that represents all textures will be appended. See first line of generated texturePool.js for understanding
folders                     | specifies folders configuration
folders.resources(in)       | resources folder from which all input folders with images taken
folders.images(out)         | folder to which all generated textureMap files put. Also it receives folders with images that are just copied
folders.images(index.html)  | path to `folders.images(out)` relative to index.html (server's root)
base64                      | encode image files (just copied and textureMaps) using dataURI scheme if base64 size < 32K (global)
compression                 | set compression options (see below) for texture map images (global)
tasks                       | array of tasks to perform

## TASK FORMAT FOR COPYING FILES

property                    | value
--------------------------- | -----------
copy                        | `true` means _"turn copy-only mode ON"_, `false or omitted` - _"turn copy-only mode OFF"_ (`default: false`).
folder(in)                  | folder with images. all images will be copied to the `folders.resources(in)/folder(in)` folder

> Each image in `folder(in)` will be loaded, image width and height will be added to `description file`

## TASK FORMAT FOR TEXTURE MAP GENERATION

property                    | value
--------------------------- | -----------
folder(in)                  | folder with images. all images will be used to generate `folders.images(out)/folder(in)` folder
texture-map(out)            | file path and name to destination file for texture map image (`output format: png`)
repeat-x                    | `true` means images will be combined into **vertical** texture map to enable application to use _backgroundRepeat: repeatX_ for any of textures generated from `folders.resources(in)/folder(in)`
repeat-y                    | `true` means images will be combined into **horizontal** texture map to enable application to use _backgroundRepeat: repeatY_ for any of textures generated from `folders.resources(in)/folder(in)`.
n-pass                      | number of approaches to try for texture map after default algorithm is finished. `0 or omitted` means do not try non-default approaches. `positive value (1 - âˆž)` will trigger additional passes with goal to find most optimal textures positioning on texture map.
base64                      | encode all copied image files (in case `copy : true;`) or texture map image using dataURI scheme (only if base64 size < 32K)
compression                 | set compression options (see below) for texture map image

> `repeat-x`: all images inside `folder(in)` folder should have the **same width**

> `repeat-y`: all images inside `folder(in)` folder should have the **same height**

compression
===========
`tinypng` - `false` (default) or `true` - use tinypng.com service (see above)

`palette` - `null` or `palette options object` (see below) (`default: null`)

palette options object
======================
option                          | description
--------------------------------|------------
`colors`                        | # of colors in desired palette. colors number <= 256 will result in 8bit indexed png.
`quantizationMethod`            | histogram method, `2`: min-population threshold within sub-regions; `1`: global top-population (`default: 2`)
`ditheringKernel`               | dithering kernel name, see available kernels below (`default: null`),
`useSerpentineDitheringPattern` | use serpentine dithering (`true` or `false`) (`default: false`)
`minimumHueColors`              | # of colors per hue group to evaluate regardless of counts, to retain low-count hues

dithering kernels
=================
* `"FloydSteinberg"`
* `"FalseFloydSteinberg"`

* `"Atkinson"`
* `"Jarvis"`
* `"Burkes"`
* `"Sierra"`
* `"TwoSierra"`

TODO
====
1) interlaced jpeg decoding (?)

2) ability to work only in memory without writing image files to disk. usable for ui tools

3) notify all maintainers of used js modules with fixed code
